Attempt to define the Rocket League replay file format in Kaitai-struct

Currently parses everything except netstream, which would be a ton of work, and I'm unsure if that's currently possible to do so in Kaitai (see https://github.com/Bakkes/rocketleaguereplay-kaitai/issues/1). If you wish to use a replay parser which has the ability to parse the network stream, check out https://github.com/rocket-league-replays/rocket-league-replays/wiki/Rocket-League-Replay-Parsers to find one for your preferred language.
