Currently parses everything except netstream ,which would be a ton of work, not sure if worth doing that yet. If you wish to use a replay parser which has the ability to parse the network stream, check out https://github.com/rocket-league-replays/rocket-league-replays/wiki/Rocket-League-Replay-Parsers to find one for your preferred language.
